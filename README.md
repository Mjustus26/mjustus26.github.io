        Shoot for the moon; even if you miss you'll land among the stars

**A little about me:** I am a **Computer Science major** (3.6 GPA) currently attending Southern New Hampshire University, with exciting projects in progress. I have been able to explore different fields under the umbrella of computer science such as programming, database work, testing, software development lifecycle, operating systems and exposure to different software, administrative and troubleshooting tasks, data analysis, and many more subjects(Relevant course work listed below!).The artifacts that I have selected to preview in this Portfolio emphasize my learning process; my work in databases, algorithms and data structures, and software engineering and design. 

A strength that I have aqcuired over the course of my degree program that is essential to work flow and productivity are time and project management. As an online student I have to manage my time efficiently to maximize my project success during study hours so that I can continue whith all my current obligations and projects to be able to meet those deadlines. 

There is always something to be learned; furthering my education has encouraged me to do my own independent research and to reflect upon projects that I completed throughout the program. Refining those skills through revision and review has made me a better student and learner; as I am able to adapt to new ideas, processes, and technologies.   


     Make sure and check out some of my projects: 
**[Software Design and Engineering - User Stories/Product Backlog]**(https://github.com/Mjustus26/mjustus26.github.io/blob/master/CS-product.backlog%26user.stories.xlsx)
This is in the heart of software design and engineering because the user stories help lay the foundation and give a description of the features of the deployment and how it will be structured. The skills illustrated were a solid understanding of the processes taken during the software development lifecycle and how user stories and the product backlog are utilized in the process. This is the project that allowed me to explore the product owner, developer and scrum master roles.


**[Algorithms and Data structures - OpenGL Project]**(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LGH4coeIfgdXpA7P8zFppt1rFBNQpVmx/view?usp=sharing)
This artifact is a project that I completed in my computer graphics class. It is written in C++ programming language and uses the modern OpenGL cross-platform library for interfacing with programmable GPUs(graphics processing unit) for rendering 3D graphics. The link above is my initial code review. I have since made several changes. I improved this artifact by breaking things up into more than one file so that my main.cpp file does not look overwhelmed with several lines of code. I cleaned it up so that it is more readable and easy to follow the project goals. **[Check it out here!]**(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KWL-Jnv4OsMu5QlClOvB7M9kO4h03pfF?usp=sharing) 

**[Databases - NoSQL MongoDB]**(https://github.com/Mjustus26/mjustus26.github.io/blob/master/CS340.Final_Project_MJ.docx.zip)
The artifact I chose for the databases category is my final project from the database class I took at Southern New Hampshire University that used MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL database system that uses collections and documents to store information. The document shows my ability to create documents and collections and how I can manipulate the data through indexing and collection creation and querying. 

I learned to connect with the database through the terminal windows and cloud storage as well because they have that option. The biggest challenges I faced were getting comfortable with a command line feel and I realized I had to have two separate terminals up one for the connection to the database and one for all the document creation and manipulation.

### Project Ideas

I am a wife, mom, cook, doer of the laundry, cleaner, nanny, and I cater to my family's needs; I have always planned out my meals and grocery lists to cut down on costs and trips to the store. I came across the idea of freezer meals recently and I love the idea of prepping everything ahead of time so that you can just take it out of the freezer the night before, pop it in the oven and your good to go! Then dishes are less and meal prep is done for the week! Then I thought how great this idea would be in an app! It would also just be great to have a central location for keeping recipes you love!

Now that we have some back story I want to design an app that holds an array of all of your favorite recipes and once you select an recipe you want it will populate a questionaire of ingredients that you need, you can then select the items needed and it will automatically be populated into a categorical grocery list that lets you check off items while you're at the store! This app would be great for pre planning the next weeks meals through random selection of the recipes that you upload to it. I will be using Python programming language in Eclipse!
